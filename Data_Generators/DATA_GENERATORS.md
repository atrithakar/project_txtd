# What are Data Generators?

**Data Generators** are utility C programs designed to generate files of a specified size filled with random data. They serve as a convenient and reliable way to test the functionality and performance of **txtd** without needing to search for suitable datasets manually.

Currently, a generator for `.txt` files containing random numerical data is available. A similar generator for `.csv` files will be added soon.

These tools not only streamline testing for the core developer but also assist contributors and users in validating **txtd** on their own systems â€” making the process faster, more consistent, and hassle-free.
